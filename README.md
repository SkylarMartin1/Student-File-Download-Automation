Download File Automation Project

This project automates the organization of downloaded study materials. Every Sunday, it creates a new folder for the upcoming academic week (e.g., Block 1 Week 1, Block 1 Week 2, etc.). The system continuously monitors the Downloads directory for new files, specifically detecting changes involving common study file types such as PDFs and PowerPoint presentations (e.g., .pdf, .pptx). When such a file is downloaded, it is automatically moved into the folder for the current week. This is also done for images and music etc.
The process repeats weekly: each Sunday, a new folder is created for the next academic week, and all subsequent downloads are sorted into that new directoryâ€”ensuring lecture notes and study materials are always neatly organized.
